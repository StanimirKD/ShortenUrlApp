2. Open Command Prompt and locate the folder "project-name".

It's probbably: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
4. From there if you click on "My Short URLs"/"Dashboard" or "Log In" you will be redirected to the Log-in page(since it's required
for you to log-in to see your shortenned links). If you click "Register" you will be able to register.
